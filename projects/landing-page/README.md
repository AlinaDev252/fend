## Instructions

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer - Nanodegree Program.

The main requirement is to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

Criterias for the Landing Page Behaviour:
Navigation -> Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list;
Section Active State ->
It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page;
Scroll to Anchor -> When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
